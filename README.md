# LaundryAtHomeMobile
This project had the goal to develop an Android application integrated with the TQS project. This application offers laundry services with the possibility of these being delivered at home.  
The end-user can choose the type of service the LaundryAtHome provides and select the items he/she wants.     
They can:
* Track their order and see the details of it
* See on the maps the delivery location that they selected in the "make order" phase.
* See all the orders that they have made using the LaundryAtHome application
* See all the states of the orders (completed or not completed)
* Add a complaint about a certain active order
* And much more
